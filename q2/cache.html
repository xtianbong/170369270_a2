        Browser cache is a folder where your browser stores certain files so that it does not have to download them every
        time you open the page. When you clear cookies, you remove the information stored about your session on the 
        site. Effectively it resets your activity there (this has nothing to do with logged in accounts) so things like 
        filled forms, shopping carts, etc will be deleted. This is why resetting cookies makes the form pop back up,
        the site does not know that you have ever been there.
